# metamorph chess

Metamorph Chess is puts a new and exciting twist on classic chess.

Essentially, after a piece is moved it has the chance to morph into a different chess piece.

This means that the game becomes much more unpredictable than traditional chess.

I wanted to develop an interesting (while perhaps impractical) web game. Chess seemed like a fun choice and so Metamorph Chess was born.

I used [chessboardjs.com] and [https://github.com/zeyu2001/chess-ai] to make this project possible.
